## How you can contribute

- See something? Say something! Submit a [bug report](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/lex_sleuther/issues) to let the community know what you've experienced or found. Bonus points if you suggest possible fixes or what you feel may resolve the issue. For example: "_Attempted to use XYZ but it errored out. Could a more descriptive error code be returned?_"
- Submit a [Pull Request](#pull-requests)

### Bug reporting and questions are handled using GitHub's issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by opening a [new issue](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/lex_sleuther/issues).

## Pull Requests

### All contributions will be submitted under the MIT license

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT [license](LICENSE) that covers the project.
If this is a concern, contact the maintainers before contributing.

### Versioning

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) as our versioning scheme. (Example: _2.1.4_)

### Pull Request template

Please use the pull request template provided, making sure the following details are included in your request:

- Is this a breaking change?
- Are all new or changed code paths covered by tests?
- A complete listing of issues addressed or closed with this change.
- A complete listing of any enhancements provided by this change.
- Any usage details developers may need to make use of this new functionality.
  - Does additional documentation need to be developed beyond what is listed in your Pull Request?
- Any other salient points of interest.

### Approval / Merging

All Pull Requests must be approved by at least one maintainer. Once approved, a maintainer will perform the merge and execute any backend
processes related to package deployment. At this time, contributors _do not_ have the ability to merge to the `main` branch.
